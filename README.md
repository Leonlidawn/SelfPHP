# SelfPHP
A new language learnt in 2017 via free online courses and PRACTICE 

Here are some short notes:

PHP runs on server. It has access to all the information and files on that machine, which allows it to construct custom HTML pages to send to your browser, handle cookies, and run tasks or perform calculations with data from that website.

-Very similar to perl
 .uses $ for parameters
 .if statement if（a<3）{}
-surround all codes with <?php ... ?>

. period is used for appending strings
 eg. echo "str "."ing ";
 
 ===import classes from pakage===
 from datetime import datetime
 now = datetime.now()
